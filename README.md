Mobile Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to give us a better understanding of your coding skills. If you have any questions or need any clarifications for this challenge, please get in touch.
Goal
Develop a currency conversion app that allows a user to view a given amount in a given currency converted into other currencies.
• Language requirements:
• Android: Kotlin
• iOS: Swift
Functional Requirements

User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies provided by the API(for currencies that are not available, convert them on the app side. When converting, floating-point error is accpetable)
User must be able to enter desired amount for selected currency
User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)


UI Suggestion:
Some way to select a currency
Some text entry widget to enter the amount
A list/grid of exchange rates
It doesn’t need to be super pretty, but it shouldn’t be broken as well ;)
What we're looking for:
An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
